/**
 * Hands the shared core the two things it cannot get for itself on Android: an
 * application Context (for preferences and the files directory) and the
 * build-time server endpoints.
 *
 * This exists so there is exactly one place that does it. The app has three
 * entry points that can start the process on their own — the activity, the
 * tracking service and the car session — and Application.onCreate runs before
 * all of them, so none has to remember. The iOS counterpart is DetourApp.init
 * in iosApp/Detour/DetourApp.swift.
