 * The one-time battery-optimization prompt flag, plus thin access to the

 * unlike a circle's `sharing` flag (real server state, see
 * `Groups.setSharing`), neither has a server column.
 *
 * The toggle itself lives in shared's [Settings], not in the bag below,
 * because iOS shows the same switch: one key and one default there beat two
 * platform-local spellings that drift the first time either is touched. The
 * battery prompt stays here - Android is the only platform with a
 * battery-optimization whitelist to be exempted from.
