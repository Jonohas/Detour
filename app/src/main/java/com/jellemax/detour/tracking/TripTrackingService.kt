 *
 *  - [LocationMode.SLEEP]: activity recognition says the phone is STILL. We
 *    ask for passive fixes only — free, but we still hear anything another app
 *    requests, so a drive is never missed if the STILL-exit event is late.
 *  - [LocationMode.IDLE]: moving around on foot. Coarse batched fixes extend
 *    the fog-of-war trace and watch for a drive starting.
 *  - [LocationMode.PROBE]: activity recognition just reported IN_VEHICLE.
 *    Tight fixes for a few minutes to confirm (or refute) a real drive.
 *  - [LocationMode.TRIP]: recording duration, distance, speed, lean and g-force.
 *    Live stats go to [stats]; the finished trip is written to [TripStore].
 *
 * Auto-start deliberately never trusts a single signal. IN_VEHICLE only opens a
 * probe window, in which sustained [PROBE_SPEED_MPS] confirms a drive; with no
 * such hint the bar is a sustained [FAST_SPEED_MPS], which catches motorcycles
 * that activity recognition misclassifies. Either way the run must last
 * [MIN_FAST_RUN_MS] and cover [MIN_FAST_RUN_METERS] from tight fixes only, so
 * indoor GPS drift while you walk around the house can't fake a trip.
