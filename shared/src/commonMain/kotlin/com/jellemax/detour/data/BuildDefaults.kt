 * The server endpoints that used to arrive through Android's generated
 * BuildConfig. The shared core cannot read BuildConfig — it does not exist on
 * iOS — so each platform pushes its own build-time values in at startup
 * instead: Android from BuildConfig, iOS from the .xcconfig baked into
 * Info.plist.
 *
 * Every field defaults to blank, which each consumer already treats as "not
 * configured, fall back to the user's own server or the public instance". So
 * a platform that forgets to call [configure] degrades exactly like a CI build with
 * no secrets, rather than crashing.
