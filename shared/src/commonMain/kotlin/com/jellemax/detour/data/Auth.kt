/**
 * The rider's session, which is now a Keycloak session.
 *
 * The backend no longer has a sign-in endpoint: it validates tokens the
 * identity provider minted and provisions a local account the first time it
 * sees a subject (see the API's CurrentUser). So everything that used to be
 * `/auth/login`, `/auth/register` and `/auth/reset` lives in the realm, and
 * what is left on this side is holding the tokens and keeping the access token
 * fresh.
 *
 * The authorization-code leg is platform code — it needs a browser and a
 * SHA-256 — and lives in `app/auth/Oidc.kt`. Everything after the redirect is
 * plain HTTP and lives here, shared, because refreshing has one rule that must
 * not be got wrong twice.
